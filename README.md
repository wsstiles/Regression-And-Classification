# Regression-And-Classification
A project space in which I explore Machine Learning concepts and algorithms related to Regression and Classification problems. In this space I explore
- Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Practical applications of Linear Regression with Maximum Liklihood and Bayesian Estimators
- Model Prediction Evaluation
- Bootstrapping
- Cross-Validation
- Classification Algorithms including: Bayesian Formulations, Logistic Regression, and kNN (k-nearest neighbors)
