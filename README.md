# Regression-And-Classification
A project space in which I explore Machine Learning concepts and algorithms related to Regression and Classification problems. In this space I explore
- Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Practical applications of Linear Regression with Maximum Liklihood and Bayesian Estimators
- Model Prediction Evaluation
- Bootstrapping
- Cross-Validation
- Classification Algorithms including: Bayesian Formulations, Logistic Regression, and kNN (k-nearest neighbors)


## Loan_Eligibility_Classification.ipynb
In this project we explore a **Logisitic Regression** problem using **supervised machine learning techniques**. The objective of the project is to use the credit history of previous lenders to train a model using classification algorithms (such as **kNN**) to help the bank prevent potential losses, and focus more on eligible customers.

#### CreditRisk.csv
Contains credit risk information on prior customer loans to be used to train the model.
