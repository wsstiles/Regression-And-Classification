# Regression-And-Classification
A project space in which I explore Machine Learning concepts and algorithms related to Regression and Classification problems. In this space I explore
- Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Practical applications of Linear Regression with Maximum Liklihood and Bayesian Estimators
- Model Prediction Evaluation
- Bootstrapping
- Cross-Validation
- Classification Algorithms including: Bayesian Formulations, Logistic Regression, and kNN (k-nearest neighbors)


## Loan_Eligibility_Classification.ipynb
In this project we explore a **Logisitic Regression** problem using **supervised machine learning techniques**. The objective of the project is to use the credit history of previous lenders to train a model using classification algorithms (such as **kNN**) to help the bank prevent potential losses, and focus more on eligible customers.

#### CreditRisk.csv
Contains credit risk information on prior customer loans to be used to train and test the model.

## Boston_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
In this project I explore a **Linear Regression** problem using supervised machine learning techniques to predict the price of a house in a given town or suburb of Boston based upon features of the locality by using regression techniques.  Using the provided data set, I am able to find a relatively accurate regression function to predict a house's price based upon the dependent variables provided.

#### Boston.csv
This is the training/testing data set used to create the linear regression model for the Boston house price prediction.

## Effects_of_Advertising_on_Sales.ipynb
In this project, I explore both **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** models and evaluate their performance. I also experiment with **Regularization** methods and **Bootstrap sampling** in an attempt to better fit the model. The data set used in the experiment looks into advertising data for ads run on different media and we seek to connect a linear combination of each feature to the sales for the company.

#### Advertising.csv
This is the file containing the advertising and sales data for the company in question.
